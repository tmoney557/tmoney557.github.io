<p>Tj is a huge fan of sports. Tj has been watching sports ever since he was a kid. Tj favorite sports team to watch is the St. Louis Cardinals. He has been watching Cardinals baseball for many years. His favorite Cardinals player ever is Albert Pujols. Albert Pujols was the best player ever to wear a Cardinals uniform in Tj&#39;s opinion. Baseball is something that Tj enjoys watching. Not only baseball is something that Tj watches but, it&#39;s something that his entire family enjoys watching. </p>
<p>Tj is also a huge Chiefs fan. He became a Chiefs fan after the St. Louis Rams unfortunately left the city in 2016. Ever since then Tj has enjoyed watching Chiefs games and is glad that the Chiefs won the Super Bowl for the 2nd time in 4 years which awesome in his opinion. Tj is a big Patrick Mahomes fan as well and Football is his second favorite sport right behind Baseball. One of Tj&#39;s goals in life is to be able to attend a Chiefs game in person. It&#39;s not easy for Tj to go to a Chiefs game because Kansas City is three hours away from St. Louis and also, the tickets are expensive. So, hopefully one day, he will accomplish one of his lifelong goals.</p>
