<p>Tj is a college student at the University of Missouri. This semester, he is taking Information Technology 1000. This class is really the first time he has really done a lot of coding. Prior to taking the class, Tj had taken a few classes in high school dealing with coding, but in those classes, Tj didn&#39;t really do that much coding in his programming classes in high school. So the class that Tj is taking now is really the first time that he is really learning about coding and really learning about what different programming languages to use.</p>

<p> Out of all the programming languages that Tj used, the programming language that he is comfortable with the most is Visual Code. The reason why that is the case is because he feels using this particular programming language editor jsut comes easy to him. Also he has way more experience using this programming language text editor compared to others.</p>
